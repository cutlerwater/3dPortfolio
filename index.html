        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Like so many in the IT industry, I became a technologist to try and change the world and to make technology more beneficial, useful and easier to learn and use.</p>

        <p>
          Technology has really grown exponentially since 2000 and every year it seems to grow beyond to the point where it's hard to keep up and not let our knowledge and capabilities become obsolete.  
          And yet it's also fun, but it can also become dangerous with a lot of the dirty players out there.  That's why like others, I tend to take the issue of security very seriously, as we all should.</p>

        <p>
          IT needs more agility so it can adapt quickly to market demands and deliver technology efficiently. The DevOps mindset is a good start, but we really need to look across the entire IT value chain. 
          It‚Äôs about getting the right work to the right team at the right time, and then optimizing workflows and operations from end to end, while also not being manipulated by bad actors.</p>

        <h2>üìú Work History</h2>

        <h3>Planet Technologies</h3>
        <p>
          I've really enjoyed working with some great technology professionals at Planet Technologies since 2018 and look forward to more projects with them.  So far I've worked with the Departments of Interior, Commerce, Justice, as well as Transportation working with a lot of Office 365 and SharePoint farms and online.  I've also worked extensively on the Power Platform, Azure and recently been diving deep on web development.
        </p>
        <h3>Applied Information Science</h3>
        <p>
          While with AIS, I had the pleasure of working with a prominent law firm in Washington D.C., the Department of Defense, a banking institution based in Philadelphia and two Senate Committees.  While there, I worked on more SharePoint projects as well as a web migration project that involved the use of Jenkins and Azure.  
        </p>
        <h3>US Air Force and Air National Guard</h3>
        <p>
          Working with the Air Force and the Air National Guard was a great experience where I was able to build new SharePoint farms, migrate a bunch of data, dive deep into a SharePoint Search project and work with some great technology professionals once again.
        </p>
        <h3>US Senate, Social Security Administration, IRS, PBGC, Northcom/Norad</h3>
        <p>
          In my earlier IT days, I've had some great experiences with installing computer equipment for US Senators and committees, as well as managing one of the biggest networks in the world (SSA), working on web sites for the Military District of Washington, and eventually getting into the SharePoint world as a farm administrator.</p>
